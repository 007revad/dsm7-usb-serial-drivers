# Missing USB serial drivers for DSM 7

For now just for [`apollolake`](https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/tutorial/What_kind_of_CPU_does_my_NAS_have).

Installable packages in `packages/`, just the kernel modules in `modules/` (I haven't tested the packages, no idea if they install or not).

## DISCLAIMER

I don't/can't test every driver. Use at your own peril.
