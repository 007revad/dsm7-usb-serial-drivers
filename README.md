# Missing USB serial drivers for DSM 7 <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=E7DEFXHFSK8Y6"><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif"></a>

For now just for [`apollolake`](https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/tutorial/What_kind_of_CPU_does_my_NAS_have), but feel free to [request other platforms](https://github.com/robertklep/dsm7-usb-serial-drivers/issues).

Installable packages in `packages/`, just the kernel modules in `modules/` (I haven't tested the packages, no idea if they install or not).

### Disclaimer

I don't/can't test every driver. Use at your own peril.

### Attribution

I'm using the source code (as-is) for the drivers included in the Linux kernel (4.4.x) from the [Synology Open Source Project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dsgpl/).
